The idea behind this is that addiction patients have a tendency to give up a long-term large reward, such as being  with their family in exchange for the more short-term reward, such as whatever substance the patient craves. With this app, the  patient will be able to have constant reminders of their future goals to prevent delayed discounting(the aforementioned process). \n\nWe hope you find this app useful in whatever need it may serve.\n\nThank you!
