# EFT
Episodic Future Thinking App

## Introduction

Based on numerous studies about addiction and research provided by a professor and researcher at McMaster University and St. Joseph's Healthcare, EFT (or Episodic Future Thinking) was an app created for iOS to make therapeutics to treat addiction accessible to all. 

Creating this app involved dedication and planning carefully following the software development life cycle to produce tangible results that could be presentable to the client and app fairs.

## Code

### Prerequisites

Must be built using MacOS.

### Build Preparation

If the app is to be installed on an iPhone or iPad, then it is necessary to add an iOS Development Certificate for the desired device, create a provisioning profile, and add the device as a trusted developer device.

Swift uses Objective-C and therefore requires a MacOS C compiler. `Clang` is the suggested compiler

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository using `git clone` to a local directory
2. Open `EFT/ViewController.swift` and run it through an iOS-based device
